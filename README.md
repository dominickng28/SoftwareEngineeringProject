A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Building and Running

First choose a simulated device to run on. The below is for windows and android but you should choose iPhone for your mac.

BLACK BOX TESTING
Testing if the navigation from the original login screen takes you to the sign up screen. When you press the sign up button you should be navigated to the next screen. <-- Testing that

Run flutter test in the terminal of the navigation_test.dart file

If it passes then you know the navigation from the login screen is correct.
